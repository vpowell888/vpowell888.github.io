## 1. Advisory Services

### Executive AI Advisor  
**What it does**  
An ongoing advisory relationship for senior leaders who need a trusted, independent sounding board as they shape and govern their AI agenda. This service focuses on clarifying where AI creates real business value, stress-testing assumptions, unblocking executive decisions, and maintaining leadership alignment as strategy, delivery, and risk evolve. Engagements typically include structured monthly or quarterly sessions, plus ad-hoc support around time-critical decisions.

**Client deliverable**  
A set of **executive decision supports**, typically including a **monthly or quarterly advisory pack** (priorities, decisions required, risks, and recommended actions), along with **issue-specific briefs** such as options analysis, trade-off papers, and leadership-ready narrative.

---

### Board-level AI Advisory  
**What it does**  
This service enables boards and executive committees to govern AI effectively by translating technical topics into business, value, and enterprise risk terms. It helps directors understand where AI creates upside, where it introduces material risk, what controls are proportionate, and what questions boards should be asking management. It also supports investor and regulator readiness by strengthening the organisation’s AI oversight posture.

**Client deliverable**  
**Board-ready materials** such as a **board briefing deck**, an **AI risk and opportunity posture statement**, **governance and oversight checklists**, and concise **decision notes** suitable for inclusion in board minutes.

---

### Startup Advisory  
**What it does**  
Advisory support for startups building or scaling AI-enabled products, focused on positioning, differentiation, and sustainable scale. The service covers go-to-market clarity, operating cadence, investor narrative, and embedding responsible AI principles into product design and delivery to avoid avoidable risk around trust, quality, and compliance.

**Client deliverable**  
A practical **startup advisor pack**, typically including **positioning and messaging guidance**, a **scale and capability plan**, and a lightweight **responsible AI operating principles document** covering quality, risk, and customer trust.

## 2. Consulting Services

### AI Strategy Design  
**What it does**  
A structured engagement to define where AI should be applied first, how value will be created, and what choices determine success.

The strategy explicitly ties AI initiatives to measurable business outcomes.

**Client deliverable**  
An **AI strategy pack** including a **prioritised use-case portfolio**, **value hypotheses and KPIs**, **buy/build/partner recommendations**, **data and platform requirements**, and an **initial risk and controls view**.

---

### AI Transformation Roadmap  
**What it does**  
Turns strategy into an executable, board-visible plan. The roadmap sequences initiatives into realistic phases (commonly 90-day, 6-month, and 12-month horizons), defines dependencies and governance, and sets expectations around cost, resourcing, and organisational change.

**Client deliverable**

### Delivery Oversight

### Fundamentals

## 3. Speaking and Keynotes

### Executive Keynotes  
**What it does**

### AI Literacy for Non-Technical Leaders
