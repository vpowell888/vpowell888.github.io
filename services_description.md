# Oblongix Advisory — Services Aligned to *The CEO’s Guide to AI Transformation*

This document describes each Oblongix Advisory service, explaining:
1) What the service does  
2) What the client receives  
3) How the service directly supports the leadership principles set out in *The CEO’s Guide to AI Transformation*

The book’s core premise is that AI success is determined by leadership, operating model redesign, and governance — not by technology alone.

## 1. Advisory Services

### Executive AI Advisor  
**What it does**  
An ongoing advisory relationship for CEOs and senior executives who need clarity, confidence, and challenge as they lead AI as a business redesign. The focus is on decision-making, trade-offs, sequencing, and accountability rather than tools or pilots.

**Client deliverable**  
- Regular **executive advisory packs** (priorities, decisions required, risks, recommendations)  
- **Decision briefs** on funding, vendors, organisational design, or escalation issues

**Book principles addressed**  
- *Declare AI a business redesign, not a technology program*  
- *Retain agency as intelligence becomes external and cheap*  
- *Lead innovation with expectation of continued uncertainty*  

This service helps CEOs personally own AI outcomes, avoid delegation drift, and retain control as AI reshapes decisions, roles, and power structures.
